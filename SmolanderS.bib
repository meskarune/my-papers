	abstract = {Using the 1-D atmospheric chemistry transport model SOSAA, we have investigated the atmospheric reactivity of a boreal forest ecosystem during the HUMPPA-COPEC-10 campaign (summer 2010, at SMEAR{\textasciitilde}II in southern Finland). For the very first time, we present vertically resolved model simulations of the NO3 and O3 reactivity (R) together with the modelled and measured reactivity of OH. We find that OH is the most reactive oxidant (R ∼ 3 s-1) followed by NO3 (R ∼ 0.07 s-1) and O3 (R ∼ 2 × 10-5s-1). The missing OH reactivity was found to be large in accordance with measurements (∼ 65\%) as would be expected from the chemical subset described in the model. The accounted OH radical sinks were inorganic compounds (∼ 41\%, mainly due to reaction with CO), emitted monoterpenes (∼ 14\%) and oxidised biogenic volatile organic compounds (∼ 44\%). The missing reactivity is expected to be due to unknown biogenic volatile organic compounds and their photoproducts, indicating that the true main sink of OH is not expected to be inorganic compounds. The NO3 radical was found to react mainly with primary emitted monoterpenes (∼ 60\%) and inorganic compounds (∼ 37\%, including NO2). NO2 is, however, only a temporary sink of NO3 under the conditions of the campaign (with typical temperatures of 20–25 °C) and does not affect the NO3 concentration. We discuss the difference between instantaneous and steady-state reactivity and present the first boreal forest steady-state lifetime of NO3 (113 s). O3 almost exclusively reacts with inorganic compounds (∼ 91\%, mainly NO, but also NO2 during night) and less with primary emitted sesquiterpenes (∼ 6\%) and monoterpenes (∼ 3\%). When considering the concentration of the oxidants investigated, we find that OH is the oxidant that is capable of removing organic compounds at a faster rate during daytime, whereas NO3 can remove organic molecules at a faster rate during night-time. O3 competes with OH and NO3 during a short period of time in the early morning (around 5 a.m. local time) and in the evening (around 7–8 p.m.). As part of this study, we developed a simple empirical parameterisation for conversion of measured spectral irradiance into actinic flux. Further, the meteorological conditions were evaluated using radiosonde observations and ground-based measurements. The overall vertical structure of the boundary layer is discussed, together with validation of the surface energy balance and turbulent fluxes. The sensible heat and momentum fluxes above the canopy were on average overestimated, while the latent heat flux was underestimated.},

	abstract = {New particle formation (NPF) is an important atmospheric phenomenon. During an NPF event, particles first form by nucleation and then grow further in size. The growth step is crucial because it controls the number of particles that can become cloud condensation nuclei. Among various physical and chemical processes contributing to particle growth, condensation by organic vapors has been suggested as important. In order to better understand the influence of biogenic emissions on particle growth, we carried out modeling studies of NPF events during the BEACHON-ROCS (Bio–hydro–atmosphere interactions of Energy, Aerosol, Carbon, H2O, Organics \& Nitrogen – Rocky Mountain Organic Carbon Study) campaign at Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory in Colorado, USA. The site is representative of the semi-arid western USA. With the latest Criegee intermediate reaction rates implemented in the chemistry scheme, the model underestimates sulfuric acid concentration by 50 \%, suggesting either missing sources of atmospheric sulfuric acid or an overestimated sink term. The results emphasize the contribution from biogenic volatile organic compound emissions to particle growth by demonstrating the effects of the oxidation products of monoterpenes and 2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO). Monoterpene oxidation products are shown to influence the nighttime particle loadings significantly, while their concentrations are insufficient to grow the particles during the day. The growth of ultrafine particles in the daytime appears to be closely related to the OH oxidation products of MBO.},

	abstract = {Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are essential in atmospheric chemistry because of their chemical reactions that produce and destroy tropospheric ozone, their effects on aerosol formation and growth, and their potential influence on global warming. As one of the important BVOC groups, monoterpenes have been a focus of scientific attention in atmospheric research. Detailed regional measurements and model estimates are needed to study emission potential and the monoterpene budget on a global scale. Since the use of empirical measurements for upscaling is limited by many physical and biological factors, such as genetic variation, temperature and light, water availability, seasonal changes, and environmental stresses, comprehensive inventories over larger areas are difficult to obtain. We applied the boundary-layer–chemistry-transport model SOSA (model to Simulate the concentrations of Organic vapours and Sulphuric Acid) to investigate Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) monoterpene emissions in a boreal coniferous forest at the SMEAR (Station for Measuring forest Ecosystem–Atmosphere Relations) II site, southern Finland. SOSA was applied to simulate monoterpene emissions with three different emission modules: the semiempirical G95, MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) 2.04 with improved descriptions of temperature and light responses and including also carbonyl emissions, and a process-based model SIM–BIM (Seasonal Isoprenoid synthase Model – Biochemical Isoprenoid biosynthesis Model). For the first time, the emission models included seasonal and diurnal variations in both quantity and chemical species of emitted monoterpenes, based on parameterizations obtained from field measurements. Results indicate that modelling and observations agreed reasonably well and that the model can be used for investigating regional air chemistry questions related to monoterpenes. The predominant modelled monoterpene concentrations, α-pinene and Δ3-carene, are consistent with observations.},

In order to quantify the direct and indirect effects, it is essential to understand the complex processes that connect aerosol particles to cloud droplets. Modern measurement techniques are able to detect particle sizes down to 1 nm in diameter, from ground to the stratosphere. However, the data are not sufficient in order to fully understand the processes. Here we demonstrate how the newly developed one-dimensional column model SOSAA was used to investigate the complex processes of aerosols at a boreal forest site for a six-month period during the spring and summer of 2010. Two nucleation mechanisms (kinetic and organic) were tested in this study, and both mechanisms produced a good prediction of the particle number concentrations in spring. However, overestimation of the particle number concentration in summer by the organic mechanism suggests that the OH oxidation products from monoterpenes may not be the essential compounds in atmospheric nucleation. In general, SOSAA was correct in predicting new particle formation events for 35\% of the time and partly correct for 45\% of the time.},

We found the millennial trends of global isoprene emissions to be mostly affected by land cover and atmospheric carbon dioxide changes, whereas monoterpene and sesquiterpene emission trends were dominated by temperature change. Isoprene emissions declined substantially in regions with large and rapid land cover change. In addition, isoprene emission sensitivity to drought proved to have significant short‐term global effects. By the end of the past millennium MEGAN isoprene emissions were 634 TgC yr−1 (13\% and 19\% less than during 1750–1850 and 1000–1200, respectively), and LPJ‐GUESS emissions were 323 TgC yr−1(15\% and 20\% less than during 1750–1850 and 1000–1200, respectively). Monoterpene emissions were 89 TgC yr−1(10\% and 6\% higher than during 1750–1850 and 1000–1200, respectively) in MEGAN, and 24 TgC yr−1 (2\% higher and 5\% less than during 1750–1850 and 1000–1200, respectively) in LPJ‐GUESS. MEGAN sesquiterpene emissions were 36 TgC yr−1(10\% and 4\% higher than during 1750–1850 and 1000–1200, respectively). Although both models capture similar emission trends, the magnitude of the emissions are different. This highlights the importance of building better constraints on VOC emissions from terrestrial vegetation.},

	abstract = {The effect of increased reaction rates of stabilized Criegee intermediates (sCIs) with SO2 to produce sulfuric acid is investigated using data from two different locations, SMEAR II, Hyytiälä, Finland, and Hohenpeissenberg, Germany. Results from MALTE, a zero-dimensional model, show that using previous values for the rate coefficients of sCI + SO2, the model underestimates gas phase H2SO4 by up to a factor of two when compared to measurements. Using the rate coefficients recently calculated by Mauldin et al. (2012) increases sulfuric acid by 30–40\%. Increasing the rate coefficient for formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) with SO2 according to the values recommended by Welz et al. (2012) increases the H2SO4 yield by 3–6\%. Taken together, these increases lead to the conclusion that, depending on their concentrations, the reaction of stabilized Criegee intermediates with SO2 could contribute as much as 33–46\% to atmospheric sulfuric acid gas phase concentrations at ground level. Using the SMEAR II data, results from SOSA, a one-dimensional model, show that the contribution from sCI reactions to sulfuric acid production is most important in the canopy, where the concentrations of organic compounds are the highest, but can have significant effects on sulfuric acid concentrations up to 100 m. The recent findings that the reaction of sCI + SO2 is much faster than previously thought together with these results show that the inclusion of this new oxidation mechanism could be crucial in regional as well as global models.},

	abstract = {The release of vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere as a result of clathrate destabilization is a potential mechanism for rapid amplification of global warming. Previous studies have calculated the enhanced warming based mainly on the radiative effect of the methane itself, with smaller contributions from the associated carbon dioxide or ozone increases. Here, we study the effect of strongly elevated methane (CH4) levels on oxidant and aerosol particle concentrations using a combination of chemistry-transport and general circulation models. A 10-fold increase in methane concentrations is predicted to significantly decrease hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations, while moderately increasing ozone (O3). These changes lead to a 70 \% increase in the atmospheric lifetime of methane, and an 18 \% decrease in global mean cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). The CDNC change causes a radiative forcing that is comparable in magnitude to the longwave radiative forcing ("enhanced greenhouse effect") of the added methane. Together, the indirect CH4-O3 and CH4-OH-aerosol forcings could more than double the warming effect of large methane increases. Our findings may help explain the anomalously large temperature changes associated with historic methane releases.},

The simulation of aerosol concentration within the atmospheric boundary layer during nucleation event days shows a highly dynamical picture, where particle formation is coupled with chemistry and turbulent transport. We have demonstrated the suitability of our turbulent mixing scheme in reproducing the most important characteristics of particle dynamics within the boundary layer.

The main novelties from this experiment are: (1) the agreement between second-order closure model results and measurements suggest that diabatic states in the layer above the canopy explain much of the modulations of the key velocity statistics inside the canopy except in the immediate vicinity of the trunk space and for very stable conditions. (2) The dimensionless turbulent kinetic energy in the trunk space is large due to a large longitudinal velocity variance but it is inactive and contributes little to momentum fluxes. (3) Near the floor layer, a logarithmic mean velocity profile is formed and vertical eddies are strongly suppressed modifying all power spectra.

	abstract = {Long‐term measurements of sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide fluxes were performed over a boreal lake in southern Finland using the direct micrometeorological eddy covariance (EC) technique. The water column was sampled weekly for dissolved carbon dioxide, and the CO2 flux was estimated also applying the concentration gradient method. Temperature and oxygen profiles of the lake were measured twice a week. The measurements covered one full open‐water period from April to November 2003, and it is the longest continuous CO2 record ever measured over a lake by EC. The sensible heat flux H was positive, that is, from the lake to the atmosphere, except in May, when it was {\textgreater}0 W/m2 at night and {\textless}0 W/m2 in daytime. The latent heat flux dominated clearly over H in spring and summer; that is, the Bowen ratio was less than 1. Higher‐moment turbulence statistics proved to be efficient in detection of frequent nonstationary situations. Applying the statistical criteria for CO2 concentration and vertical wind speed, averaging over a 5‐min period and selecting only the wind direction with longest fetch, we could obtain lake‐representative CO2 fluxes. Footprint analysis based on a closure model revealed that the source areas were relatively short because of the presence of turbulence generated by the surrounding forest, compared to a larger lake with an extended smooth surface. We observed a net CO2 source of 0.2–0.4 μmol m−2 s−1 excluding July, when the flux was closer to zero. The results are consistent with the gradient method, based on more infrequent sampling, and both methods gave the same average flux, 0.2 μmol m−2 s−1, over the whole open‐water period. },

	abstract = {The first genetic linkage map for silver birch, Betula pendula Roth, was constructed by using a pseudo-testcross mapping strategy and integration of linkage data from 3 unrelated 2-generation pedigrees. The map is based on the genetic inheritance and segregation of 82 amplified fragment length polyhmorphisms and 19 microsatellite markers, and was constructed by simultaneously comparing the performance of CRI-MAP and OUTMAP packages. The analysis revealed 16 linkage groups, and the total map coverage is 1561 cM (Kosambi units). Average map distance between adjacent markers is 15.5 cM. Linkage groups range between 6 and 18 loci and from 81.2 to 326.5 cM; the remaining 9 linkage groups consist of 2 or 3 loci ranging from 6.3 to 42.4 cM. The uncertainty of the map is illustrated with sensitivity analysis. This initial map can serve as a basis for developing a more detailed genetic map.},

	abstract = {Thinning is a routine forest management operation that changes tree spacing, number, and size distribution and affects the material flows between vegetation and the atmosphere. Here, using direct micrometeorological ecosystem‐scale measurements, we show that in a boreal pine forest, thinning decreases the deposition velocities of fine particles as expected but does not reduce the carbon sink, water vapor flux, or ozone deposition. The thinning decreased the all‐sided leaf area index from 8 to 6, and we suggest that the redistribution of sources and sinks within the ecosystem compensated for this reduction in foliage area. In the case of water vapor and O3, changes in light penetration and among‐tree competition seem to increase individual transpiration rates and lead to larger stomatal apertures, thus enhancing also O3 deposition. In the case of CO2, increased ground vegetation assimilation and decreased autotrophic respiration seem to cancel out opposite changes in canopy assimilation and heterotrophic respiration. Current soil‐vegetation‐atmosphere transfer models should be able to reproduce these observations. },

	abstract = {Simulations of the different components of the spectral radiation budget of structurally simple leaf and shoot canopies with varying canopy leaf area index (LAI) were performed. The aims were (1) to test a proposed parameterization of the budget using two spectrally invariant canopy structural parameters (p and pt) governing canopy absorption and transmittance, respectively, and (2) to incorporate the effect of within-shoot scattering in the parameterization for shoot canopies. Results showed that canopy spectral absorption and scattering were well described by a single parameter, the canopy p value or ‘recollision probability’, which was closely related to LAI. The relationship between p and LAI was however different in leaf and shoot canopy: e.g., at the same LAI the recollision probability was larger in the shoot canopy. It was shown that the p value of the shoot canopy could be decomposed into the p value of an individual shoot (psh) and the p value of the leaf canopy with the same effective LAI (LAIe). The canopy p value allows calculation of canopy absorption and scattering at any given wavelength from the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient at the same wavelength. To calculate canopy reflectance, separation of the downward and upward scattered parts is needed in addition. The proposed parameter pt worked rather well in the leaf canopy at moderate values of LAI, but not in the coniferous shoot canopy nor at high values of LAI. However, the simulated fraction of upward scattered radiation increased in a straightforward manner with LAI, and was not particularly sensitive to the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient. Judged by this ‘smooth’ behavior, the existence of another kind of simple parameterization for this separation remains an interesting possibility.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of a coniferous shoot gives rise to multiple scattering of light between the needles of the shoot, causing the shoot spectral reflectance to differ from that of a flat leaf. Forest reflectance models based on the radiative transfer equation handle shoot level clumping by correcting the radiation attenuation coefficient with a clumping index. The clumping index causes a reduction in the interception of radiation by the canopy at a fixed leaf area index (LAI). In this study, we show how within-shoot multiple scattering is related to shoot scale clumping and derive a similar, but wavelength dependent, correction to the scattering coefficient. The results provide a method for integrating shoot structure into current radiative transfer equation based forest reflectance models. The method was applied to explore the effect of shoot scale clumping on canopy spectral reflectance using simple model canopies with a homogeneous higher level structure. The clumping of needles into shoots caused a wavelength dependent reduction in canopy reflectance, as compared to that of a leaf canopy with similar interception. This is proposed to be one reason why coniferous and broad-leaved canopies occupy different regions in the spectral space and exhibit different dependency of spectral vegetation indices on LAI.},

	abstract = {We investigated effects of nutrient availability on shoot structure and light-interception efficiency based on data from control (C) and irrigated + fertilized (IL) trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The sampling of 1-year-old shoots was designed to cover the variation in canopy exposure within the live crown zone, where current-year shoots were still found. Canopy openness was used as a measure of light availability at the shoot's position. Openness values for the sample shoots ranged from 0.02 to 0.77 on the IL plot, and from 0.10 to 0.96 on the C plot.

Among needle dimensions, needle width increased most with canopy openness. At fixed canopy openness, needle width was larger, and the ratio of needle thickness to width was smaller in IL trees than in C trees. Specific needle area (SNA) and the ratio of shoot silhouette area to total needle area (STAR) decreased with canopy openness, so that the combined effect was a threefold decrease in the ratio of shoot silhouette area to unit dry mass (SMR = STAR × SNA) along the studied range of openness values. This means that the light-interception efficiency of shoots per unit needle dry mass was three times higher for the most shaded shoots than for sun shoots. A test of the effect of fertilization on the relationships of SNA, STAR and SMR indicated statistically significant differences in both slope and intercept for SNA and STAR, and in the intercept for SMR. However, the differences partly cancelled each other so that, at medium values of canopy openness, differences between treatments in predicted SNA, STAR and SMR were small. At 0.5 canopy openness, predicted STAR of IL shoots was 6.1\% larger than STAR of C shoots, but SMR of IL shoots was 10\% smaller than that of C shoots. The results suggest that light-interception efficiency per unit needle area or mass of the shoots is not greatly affected by fertilization.},

	abstract = {We present an operational method for estimating the amount of PAR intercepted by a coniferous shoot. Interception of PAR by a shoot is divided into three components: the amount of radiation coming from the sky, the transmission of radiation through the surrounding vegetation, and the shoot's silhouette area facing the direction of the incoming radiation. All three components usually vary with direction. Radiation incident from the sky consists of direct and diffuse radiation. The well-known equation of motion for the sun and Beer's Law for atmospheric transmittance are used to simulate the directional distribution of direct sunlight for any given period of time. The diffuse component is assumed to be uniform. Meteorological field measurements are used to calibrate the absolute amounts of the direct and diffuse components. The gap fraction (proportion of visible sky) in different directions around a shoot is measured by analyzing a hemispherical fish-eye photograph, taken at the location of the shoot, with an image processing program. Similarly, the shoot silhouette area (SSA) is measured by photographing the shoot from many different directions. The measurements of SSA are interpolated by a method called trigonometric interpolation to obtain the directional distribution of SSA over the entire hemisphere. This distribution is then rotated according to the shoot's position in the canopy. Multiplying incoming PAR, canopy gap fraction and SSA in different directions, and summing over all directions, gives an estimate of PAR intercepted by the shoot during the chosen period of time. The method is described step by step, and applied, as an example, to a shoot from a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in central Finland. Differences in radiation interception properties between sun and shade shoots and their relevance to canopy-scale models are discussed.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of variation in shoot structure and needle morphology on the distributions of light and nitrogen within a Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) canopy. Specifically, we investigated the role of morphological shade acclimation in the determination of resource use efficiency, which is claimed to be optimal when the distribution of nitrogen within the canopy is directly proportional to the distribution of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Shoots were collected from different heights in the crowns of trees representing four different size classes. A new method was developed to estimate seasonal light interceptance (SLI, intercepted PAR per unit needle area) of the shoots using a model for the directional distribution of above-canopy PAR, measurements of shoot silhouette area and canopy gap fraction in different directions. The ratio SLI/SLIo, where the reference value SLIo represents the seasonal light interceptance of a spherical surface at the shoot location, was used to quantify the efficiency of light capture by a shoot. The ratio SLI/SLIo doubled from the top to the bottom of the canopy, mainly as a result of smaller internal shading in shade shoots than in sun shoots. Increased light-capturing efficiency of shade shoots implies that the difference in intercepted light by sun shoots versus shade shoots is much less than the decrease in available light from the upper to the lower canopy. For example, SLI of the five most sunlit shoots was only about 20 times greater than the SLI of the five most shaded shoots, whereas SLIo was 40 times greater for sun shoots than for shade shoots. Nitrogen content per unit needle area was about three times higher in sun needles than in shade needles. This variation, however, was not enough to produce proportionality between the amounts of nitrogen and intercepted PAR throughout the canopy.},

However, the shared vision has resulted in coherent research which crosses the disciplinary bounders and has produced an integrated programme covering a range of temporal and spatial scales.
The measurements at two long-term stations SMEAR I and II have been designed to study material and energy fluxes over forests at two geophysical locations. The result is a unique data set, providing insights into the climatological control of the carbon cycle in coniferous forests of northern Europe. The analysis starts from the space and time element level and is extended via ecosystems to boreal forests. The predictive power of the several theories proposed is high.
There are several crucial feedbacks from forests to the climate system. The mechanisms for those feedbacks are elaborated in the book: they involve changes in the carbon cycle, albedo, N2O emissions and the production of aerosols. Much of this work is new and the feedback relationships have not yet been incorporated into models of the climate system.
The book will be an important introduction for students and climate modellers alike, providing conceptual tools and ideas that are broadly applicable to terrestrial systems},

	url = {http://www.dissertationesforestales.fi/article/1805},
	abstract = {This work develops methods to account for shoot structure in models of coniferous canopy
radiative transfer. Shoot structure, as it varies along the light gradient inside canopy, affects
the efficiency of light interception per unit needle area, foliage biomass, or foliage nitrogen.
The clumping of needles in the shoot volume also causes a notable amount of multiple scat-
tering of light within coniferous shoots. The effect of shoot structure on light interception is
treated in the context of canopy level photosynthesis and resource use models, and the phe-
nomenon of within-shoot multiple scattering in the context of physical canopy reflectance
models for remote sensing purposes.
Light interception. A method for estimating the amount of PAR (Photosynthetically Ac-
tive Radiation) intercepted by a conifer shoot is presented. The method combines modelling
of the directional distribution of radiation above canopy, fish-eye photographs taken at shoot
locations to measure canopy gap fraction, and geometrical measurements of shoot orienta-
tion and structure. Data on light availability, shoot and needle structure and nitrogen content
has been collected from canopies of Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) and
Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Shoot structure acclimated to light gradient inside
canopy so that more shaded shoots have better light interception efficiency. Light intercep-
tion efficiency of shoots varied about two-fold per needle area, about four-fold per needle
dry mass, and about five-fold per nitrogen content. Comparison of fertilized and control
stands of Norway spruce indicated that light interception efficiency is not greatly affected by
fertilization.
Light scattering. Structure of coniferous shoots gives rise to multiple scattering of light
between the needles of the shoot. Using geometric models of shoots, multiple scattering
was studied by photon tracing simulations. Based on simulation results, the dependence of
the scattering coefficient of shoot from the scattering coefficient of needles is shown to fol-
low a simple one-parameter model. The single parameter, termed the recollision probability,
describes the level of clumping of the needles in the shoot, is wavelength independent, and
can be connected to previously used clumping indices. By using the recollision probability
to correct for the within-shoot multiple scattering, canopy radiative transfer models which
have used leaves as basic elements can use shoots as basic elements, and thus be applied for
coniferous forests. Preliminary testing of this approach seems to explain, at least partially,
why coniferous forests appear darker than broadleaved forests in satellite data.},

Menetelmän avulla tutkittiin verson ja neulasten morfologian vaikutusta valon ja typen jakaumaan havumetsikön latvustossa. Erityisesti tutkittiin varjostukseen mukautumisen yhteyttä resurssienkäytön tehokkuuteen. Neulasten fotosynteesiresurssien mittana käytettiin niiden typpipitoisuutta. Tutkimuskohteena oli purppurapihtametsikkö Kalliovuorilla. Verson sitoman säteilyn määrä riippuu taivaalta tulevasta säteilystä, ympäröivän kasvuston varjostuksesta ja verson muodosta. Näiden kaikkien tunteminen kaikissa suunnissa on tarpeen kasvin sitomaa säteilyä arvioitaessa. Taivaalta tuleva säteily koostuu suorasta ja diffuusista säteilystä. Suoran säteilyn suuntajakaumaa simuloitiin käyttäen Auringon liikeyhtälöitä ja Beerin lakia säteilyn sammumisesta ilmakehässä. Diffuusin säteilyn suuntajakauma oletettiin tasaiseksi. Suoran ja diffuusin säteilyn absoluuttiset arvot kalibroitiin meteorologisten kenttämittausten mukaisiksi. Verson kohdalta katsoen tietyssä suunnassa näkyvä avoimen taivaan osuus, aukkoisuus, analysoitiin kuvankäsittelyohjelmistolla versojen kohdalta otetuista ylöspäin suunnatuista kalansilmäkuvista. Versojen silhuettialat analysoitiin kuvaamalla versoja monista eri suunnista, ja interpoloimalla mitattuja arvoja trigonometrisellä interpoloinnilla. Yhdistämällä tieto verson silhuettialasta eri suunnista katsottuna ja verson alkuperäisestä asennosta kasvustossa, verson kohdalta otetusta kalansilmäkuvasta analysoitu aukkoisuus sekä säteilyn suuntajakauma kasvuston yllä kasvukauden aikana, saatiin arviot versojen kasvukauden aikana sitomasta säteilystä. 47 versoa kerättiin tasaisesti latvuston eri korkeuksilta. Keskimääräinen säteilykentän voimakkuus aineiston viiden valoisimman verson ympärillä oli 43-kertainen viiden varjoisimman verson keskiarvoon verrattuna. Tuuheiden valoversojen itsevarjostus oli lähes kaksinkertainen litteiden varjoversojen itsevarjostukseen nähden. Tämä tasoitti 43-kertaisen vaihtelyn säteilykentän voimakkuudessa 24-kertaiseksi vaihteluksi projisoitua neulasalaa kohti sidotussa säteilyssä. Lisäksi valoversojen neulaset olivat varjoversojen neulasia paksumpia. Tämä vaihtelu neulasten ominaispinta-alassa oli yli kaksinkertaista. Verson kuivapainoyksikköä kohti sidotun säteilyn määrä vaihteli enää 10-kertaisesti. Valtapuiden valoversojen typpipitoisuus kuivapainoyksikköä kohden oli noin 1,6-kertainen valtapuiden varjoversojen typpipitoisuuteen nähden. Kuitenkin suurin typpipitoisuuden vaihtelu havaittiin aluspuiden varjoversojen kesken. Täten koko aineistossa typpipitoisuus ei vaihdellut säteilyn saatavuuden kanssa samansuuntaisesti. Valaistusoloihin mukautumisen pääasiallinen mekanismi näyttää olevan versojen ja neulasten morfologinen mukautuminen. 

In this work, a method has been developed to estimate the radiation bound to the coniferous tree during the growing season. The method was used to study the effect of sprout and needle morphology on the distribution of light and nitrogen on the coniferous foreshadow. In particular, the connection to the shadow alignment with the efficiency of resource use was studied. The amount of nitrogen in their need for photosynthesis resources was used. The object of the study was purplish palm trees at Kalliovuorilla. The amount of radiation emitted by the versus depends on the radiation coming from the sky, the shading of the surrounding crop, and the shape of the shoot. Knowing all of these in all directions is necessary when assessing plant-bound radiation. Radiation from the sky consists of direct and diffuse radiation. The direct distribution of the radiation was simulated using the Sun's motion equations and the Beer's law on the extinction of radiation in the atmosphere. Diffusion radiation distribution was assumed to be even. The absolute values ​​of direct and diffuse radiation were calibrated to match the meteorological field measurements. From the point of view of the verse, the open skies, aperture, visible in a certain direction, were analyzed by the image editing software of the upward-directed fish-eye images of shoots. The silhouette fields of the shoots were analyzed by describing shoots from many different directions, and by interpolating the measured values ​​by trigonometric interpolation. By comparing information about the silhouette sector seen from different angles and the versatility of the original position in the crop, the aperture analyzed from the fish-eye view of the shoot and the distribution of radiation over the vegetation over the growing season, estimates of radiation bound during the growing season were obtained. 47 shoots were collected evenly from different heights of the platform. The average radiant field intensity around the five most luminous shoots of the material was 43 times the average of the five most sharper verses. The self-shadding of the bulkheads was almost double as compared to the self-shaping of flat-sided shadows. This paved the 43-fold change in the intensity of the radiation field to a 24-fold variation of the projected needle block in bound radiations. In addition, the needle heads were thicker than the needle nose. This variation in the specific surface area of ​​the needles was more than doubled. The amount of radiation bound by the per unit of dry weight unit varied 10 times. The nitrogen content of the river valleys in the dry weight unit was about 1.6-fold in relation to the nitrogen content of the shingles of the mainland. However, the greatest fluctuation in nitrogen content was observed between the underside shadows. Thus, throughout the material, the nitrogen content did not fluctuate parallel to the availability of radiation. The main mechanism of adaptation to lighting conditions seems to be the morphological adaptation of shoots and needles.},
